# ROS_Camera_Publisher_and_Subscriber

This repository consists of ROS Nodes to Publish and Subscribe the Camera Images as a sequence (Video)

The code is entirely done in Python.

#Required Modules

1. ROS-Noetic
2. Python3
3. CV2 (OpenCV Python Package)
4. Rospy

## Notes:

1. It is noted that when we use inbuilt Camera Module of Raspberry Pi 4, the lag is very high.
2. If we use a USB Camera (even High Resolution), the lag is comapritiviely lesser that the previous one.
3. So, inorder to avoid this limitation, it is advised to use a USB Camera connected to Raspberry Pi 4.
